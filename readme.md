Community-driven Google Protobuf game library.

# Instructions

Clone/download the repository, run `npm install -g`, make sure `$NODE_PATH` is setup correctly, and write your server/client.

# Requirements

Node.js >= 0.4.8 recommended. Mac OS X is required for `vendor/protobuf_for_node.node`, otherwise compile it yourself :)
